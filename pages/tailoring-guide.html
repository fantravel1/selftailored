        <span class="tag">Know Before You Go</span>
        <h2 class="text-h1">Tailoring Cost Guide</h2>
        <p>Most alterations cost less than a new garment. Here is what you can expect to pay for the 12 most common women's alterations. Prices are typical U.S. averages and may vary by location and complexity.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tailoring-grid reveal">
        <!-- Card 1: Hem Pants -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1594938298603-c8148c4dae35?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Tailor hemming pants with measuring tape" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$10 — $15</span>
            <h4>Hem Pants</h4>
            <p>The single most impactful alteration. Clean hems transform any pair of pants from sloppy to polished. Works on jeans, trousers, and wide-legs. Ask for a blind hem for an invisible finish on dress pants.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 2: Taper Leg -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558618666-fcd25c85f82e?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Slim-fit tapered trousers on hanger" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$15 — $25</span>
            <h4>Taper the Leg</h4>
            <p>Slim the leg from knee to ankle for a modern, streamlined silhouette. Turns frumpy bootcuts into sleek straight-legs. One of the best ways to update older pants without buying new ones.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 3: Shorten Sleeves -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556905055-8f358a7a47b2?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Woman adjusting blazer sleeves" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$15 — $20</span>
            <h4>Shorten Sleeves</h4>
            <p>Too-long sleeves make even expensive blazers look borrowed. This quick fix has massive visual impact. For blazers, the sleeve should end at the wrist bone, showing a sliver of shirt cuff underneath.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 4: Add Darts -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1445205170230-053b83016050?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Fitted blouse with darts on mannequin" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$15 — $30</span>
            <h4>Add Darts</h4>
            <p>Darts create shape where there is none. Transform a boxy blouse into a fitted masterpiece that follows your curves. Back darts, bust darts, or waist darts — each targets a different fit problem.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 5: Take In Waist -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1434389677669-e08b4cda3a00?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Jeans waistband being adjusted" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$15 — $25</span>
            <h4>Take In the Waist</h4>
            <p>The waistband fix for jeans, skirts, and trousers. If your waist-to-hip ratio causes a gap at the back of every pair of pants, this one alteration solves it. One of the most requested alterations worldwide.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 6: Move Buttons -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1441984904996-e0b6ba687e04?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Close-up of buttons on a tailored shirt" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$5 — $10</span>
            <h4>Move Buttons</h4>
            <p>A tiny shift in button placement can eliminate gaping and improve the entire fit of a garment. This is the cheapest and fastest alteration — and it solves the dreaded bust-gap on button-downs instantly.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 7: Shorten Dress -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496747611176-843222e1e57c?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Woman in a well-fitted dress" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$15 — $25</span>
            <h4>Shorten a Dress</h4>
            <p>The wrong hemline can ruin an otherwise perfect dress. Whether you are going from midi to knee-length or adjusting a maxi, hemming a dress transforms its proportions and makes it feel intentional.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 8: Add Lining -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1469334031218-e382a71b716b?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Interior lining of a well-made garment" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$25 — $40</span>
            <h4>Add Lining</h4>
            <p>Lining makes cheap fabrics drape better, prevents static cling, and adds a layer of comfort. It turns a see-through blouse into a wearable piece and makes inexpensive skirts hang like designer ones.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 9: Let Out Seams -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487222477894-8943e31ef7b2?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Seam allowance on a garment being adjusted" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$20 — $35</span>
            <h4>Let Out Seams</h4>
            <p>If a garment is slightly too tight, a tailor can let out the seams for extra room. This only works if there is enough seam allowance — usually 0.5 to 1 inch is available. Check the inside seams before committing.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 10: Replace Zipper -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515886657613-9f3515b0c78f?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Close-up of dress zipper detail" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$15 — $25</span>
            <h4>Replace Zipper</h4>
            <p>A broken zipper does not mean the garment is dead. Replacing a zipper is one of the most common repairs and gives a second life to dresses, skirts, and pants. Invisible zippers cost slightly more.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 11: Adjust Shoulders -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509631179647-0177331693ae?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Woman wearing a perfectly fitted blazer" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$40 — $60</span>
            <h4>Adjust Shoulders</h4>
            <p>The most advanced alteration on this list. Shoulder adjustments involve restructuring the entire top of a garment. Only worthwhile on investment pieces like blazers, coats, or suits. Find a specialist tailor.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 12: Hem Jacket -->
        <div class="tailoring-card">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1483985988355-763728e1935b?w=500&h=320&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Tailored jacket length being measured" loading="lazy" class="tailoring-card-img">
          <div class="tailoring-card-body">
            <span class="tailoring-card-price">$20 — $30</span>
            <h4>Hem a Jacket</h4>
            <p>A jacket that is too long throws off your entire silhouette. Cropping it to just the right length — at the hip bone for most women — creates the illusion of longer legs and a cleaner overall line.</p>

        <h2 class="text-h1">What to Tailor vs. What Not to Tailor</h2>
        <p>Not every garment is worth the trip to the tailor. Here is how to decide what is worth altering and what to skip.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-2 reveal">
        <!-- DO Tailor Column -->
        <div class="category-card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--st-warm);">
          <div>
            <h4 style="color: var(--st-warm);">DO Tailor These</h4>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: var(--space-md) 0 0 0; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: var(--space-sm);">
              <li><strong>Pants that are too long.</strong> Hemming is cheap, fast, and the most impactful alteration you can get. Never let pants bunch at the ankle.</li>
              <li><strong>Button-downs that gap at the bust.</strong> Moving buttons or adding a hidden snap costs under $10 and solves this instantly.</li>
              <li><strong>Dresses that are almost perfect but slightly too long.</strong> Hemming a dress changes its entire proportion and can make a $40 dress look like $200.</li>
              <li><strong>Blazers with too-long sleeves.</strong> Sleeve length is one of the biggest signals of fit quality. Get them shortened to the wrist bone.</li>
              <li><strong>Jeans that gap at the waist.</strong> Taking in the waistband eliminates the most common fit complaint in women's denim.</li>
              <li><strong>Boxy blouses.</strong> Adding darts takes 10 minutes and creates shape that transforms the garment from shapeless to structured.</li>
              <li><strong>Vintage or thrift finds that are close but not quite right.</strong> Tailoring is what makes secondhand shopping actually work.</li>
              <li><strong>Investment pieces you plan to wear 50+ times.</strong> Spending $30 to perfect a $150 blazer is one of the best style ROI decisions you can make.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- DON'T Tailor Column -->
        <div class="category-card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--st-charcoal);">
          <div>
            <h4 style="color: var(--st-charcoal);">DON'T Tailor These</h4>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: var(--space-md) 0 0 0; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: var(--space-sm);">
              <li><strong>Garments that are more than 2 sizes too big.</strong> Beyond two sizes, the entire garment structure falls apart — armholes, seam lines, and proportions shift too much.</li>
              <li><strong>Cheap fast-fashion made from ultra-thin fabric.</strong> The material will not hold up to alteration. The seams will pucker and the fabric may tear at the needle.</li>
              <li><strong>Heavily beaded or embellished pieces.</strong> Beading makes alterations extremely time-consuming and expensive. The cost usually exceeds the garment's value.</li>
              <li><strong>Leather, suede, or PU leather at a standard tailor.</strong> These materials require specialized tools and expertise. A regular tailor can ruin leather permanently.</li>
              <li><strong>Garments with complex prints that need matching.</strong> Plaid, stripes, and large-scale patterns must be aligned at every seam. This adds significant cost and skill requirements.</li>
              <li><strong>Anything where the alteration cost exceeds 50% of the garment value.</strong> The math does not work. Spend that money on a garment that fits better from the start.</li>
              <li><strong>Shoulder restructuring on inexpensive jackets.</strong> At $40-60, shoulder work costs more than most fast-fashion blazers. Save it for investment-grade outerwear.</li>
              <li><strong>Trendy items you will only wear one season.</strong> Tailoring is an investment in longevity. Do not spend tailoring money on pieces with a short lifespan.</li>

        <p>A successful tailor appointment starts before you walk in the door. Bring these items to get the best possible result from every alteration.</p>

            <h4>The Shoes You Will Wear</h4>
            <p>Heel height changes everything. Pants hemmed with flats will be too short with heels, and vice versa. Always bring the exact shoes you plan to pair with the garment. If you wear it with multiple shoes, hem to the tallest pair and accept a slight break with flats.</p>

            <h4>The Right Undergarments</h4>
            <p>Wear the bra, shapewear, or slip you plan to wear under the garment. Different bras create different bust shapes, and shapewear changes your silhouette. The tailor needs to see the real picture.</p>

            <h4>Reference Photos</h4>
            <p>A picture is worth a thousand words — especially for hemline length, taper angles, and neckline adjustments. Show your tailor exactly what you want. Save screenshots from Instagram, Pinterest, or this site.</p>

          <div>
            <h4>Belts and Accessories</h4>
            <p>If you wear the garment with a belt, bring the belt. It changes where the waist falls and how much fabric needs adjustment. Same for scarves that change necklines or bags that hit at the hip.</p>

            <h4>A Clear Description of the Problem</h4>
            <p>Be specific. Instead of "it doesn't fit right," say "the waist gaps about two inches in the back when I sit down" or "the sleeves cover my knuckles." Precision helps your tailor deliver exactly what you need.</p>

            <span>Dart</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>A stitched fold of fabric that shapes a flat piece of cloth to fit the body's curves. Darts are typically found at the bust, waist, or back of a garment. Adding darts to a boxy top transforms it from shapeless to sculpted. There are straight darts, curved darts, and French darts — each creates a slightly different silhouette.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Seam Allowance</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>The extra fabric between the stitch line and the raw edge of the fabric. Seam allowance determines how much a garment can be let out. Standard seam allowance is 5/8 inch, but some garments — especially fast fashion — have very little. Check the inside seams before asking a tailor to let something out; if the allowance is minimal, letting out is not possible.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Blind Hem</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>A hemming technique where the stitches are invisible from the outside of the garment. The needle catches only a tiny thread of the outer fabric, making the hem look like it was never altered. Ideal for dress pants, skirts, and formal dresses. Ask for a blind hem when you want a clean, professional finish with no visible stitch line.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Tapering</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Gradually narrowing a garment — usually the leg of pants — from one point to another. Tapering from the knee to the ankle turns a wide-leg or bootcut pant into a straight or slim-leg. The key is specifying where the taper should start and how narrow you want the opening. Bring reference photos for best results.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Taking In</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Reducing the width of a garment by sewing the seams closer together. Taking in the waist means making the waistband smaller. Taking in the sides means making the overall garment narrower. The opposite of letting out. This is one of the most common alterations and works on almost every garment type.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Letting Out</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>The opposite of taking in — releasing existing seams to make a garment slightly larger. This only works if there is sufficient seam allowance (extra fabric inside the seams). Higher-quality garments typically have more seam allowance, making them easier to let out. You can usually gain 0.5 to 1 inch per seam.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Princess Seam</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>A long, curved seam running vertically from the shoulder or armhole over the bust and down to the hem. Princess seams replace darts by building shape directly into the seam lines. Garments with princess seams are easier to alter for bust fit because the tailor can adjust the curve of the seam rather than adding separate darts.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Ease</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>The difference between your body measurements and the garment measurements. Ease is the extra room built into a garment for comfort and movement. Zero ease means the garment fits like a second skin. Negative ease means the fabric stretches. Understanding ease helps you communicate whether you want a garment fitted, comfortable, or relaxed.</p>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Bias Cut</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Fabric cut diagonally across the grain, at a 45-degree angle. Bias-cut garments drape beautifully and cling to the body's curves. However, they are harder and more expensive to alter because the fabric stretches and moves unpredictably. If you need a bias-cut garment altered, find a tailor who specializes in this technique.</p>

            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>A layer of stiff or semi-stiff fabric fused or sewn to the inside of a garment to add structure and support. Interfacing is found in collars, cuffs, waistbands, and button plackets. It is what makes a shirt collar stand up and a waistband hold its shape. When a tailor works on these areas, they must account for the interfacing layer.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>The fold of fabric that forms where pants meet the shoe. A "full break" means a deep fold with fabric pooling. A "half break" has a slight fold. "No break" means the pants just touch the top of the shoe with zero folding. For women's pants, a clean half-break or no-break usually looks the most polished and modern.</p>

            <p>The small supplies used in garment construction and alteration: buttons, zippers, snaps, hooks, thread, elastic, and more.

          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Start with Google reviews and local recommendations. Visit in person before committing — a clean, organized shop is a good sign. Start with a simple alteration like hemming to test their quality. A good tailor asks questions, checks measurements twice, and is honest about what can and cannot be done. Avoid anyone who promises everything.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Hemming pants typically costs $10-15 at most tailors. This is the single most impactful alteration you can get. The price may be slightly higher for jeans (the thick denim requires a special needle) or for blind hems on dress pants. Some tailors offer discounts if you bring multiple items at once.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Absolutely — with caveats. A $30 blouse with $15 darts will look better than a $200 blouse that does not fit. The rule of thumb: the alteration cost should not exceed 50% of the garment's price for everyday items. For special occasion or high-wear items, you can stretch that ratio because the cost-per-wear still works out.</p>

            <span>Can a tailor make something bigger?</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Yes, but only within limits. A tailor can "let out" seams if there is enough seam allowance — typically gaining 0.5 to 1 inch per seam. Higher-quality garments usually have more seam allowance. Check the inside of the garment before your appointment. If the seam allowance is very narrow (common in fast fashion), letting out may not be feasible.</p>

            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Hemming pants. It sounds simple, but a clean hem is the difference between looking put-together and looking sloppy. After that, adding darts to tops and taking in waistbands are the next highest-impact alterations. These three alterations cover about 80% of fit problems women experience with off-the-rack clothing.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Should I wash clothes before taking them to the tailor?</span>
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Yes. Always wash or dry-clean garments before alteration. Many fabrics shrink slightly on the first wash, so altering before washing can result in a garment that no longer fits after the first laundry day. This is especially important for cotton, linen, and denim. Pre-washing ensures the tailor marks and hems on the final size of the fabric.</p>
