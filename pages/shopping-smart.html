        <div class="section-header reveal">
          <span class="tag">Know Your Fabrics</span>
          <h2 class="text-h2">The Fabric Guide</h2>
          <p>The fabric is the single most important factor in how a garment looks, feels, drapes, and lasts. Learn to read labels and touch fabric before you ever look at the price tag.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="detail-tip reveal">
          <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
          <p>Always check the fabric composition on the label before trying anything on. A garment that is 95% polyester at $80 is almost never worth it. The same silhouette in cotton or a quality blend will look and feel dramatically different.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-auto reveal">
          <!-- Cotton -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558171813-4c088753af8f?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Cotton fabric close-up showing natural texture" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Cotton</h3>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Breathable, durable, easy to wash, soft against skin, absorbs dye well, affordable. The workhorse of natural fibers.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Wrinkles easily, can shrink in hot water, may lose shape over time without elastane blend, slower to dry.</p>
              <p><strong>Care:</strong> Machine wash cold or warm. Tumble dry low. Iron while slightly damp for best results. Pre-wash before tailoring.</p>
              <p><strong>Tailoring note:</strong> Cotton takes alterations beautifully. It holds stitches well, presses crisply, and is forgiving to work with. Ideal for beginners learning to sew.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Linen -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596755094514-f87e34085b2c?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Linen fabric with natural wrinkled texture" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Linen</h3>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely breathable, strongest natural fiber, gets softer with each wash, naturally antibacterial, elegant drape when quality is high.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Wrinkles aggressively (this is part of the charm), can feel stiff when new, tends to be more expensive, limited stretch.</p>
              <p><strong>Care:</strong> Machine wash gentle cycle cold. Hang dry or tumble dry low. Embrace the wrinkles or steam lightly. Never use chlorine bleach.</p>
              <p><strong>Tailoring note:</strong> Linen frays easily, so seams need finishing. A tailor should use French seams or serge edges. Allow extra seam allowance for alterations.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Wool -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1617244876428-45afdd9320d6?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Wool fabric texture showing weave detail" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Wool</h3>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Naturally temperature-regulating, wrinkle-resistant, excellent drape in suiting, absorbs moisture without feeling wet, naturally flame-resistant.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can felt if machine washed incorrectly, higher cost, some people find it itchy, moths love it, requires more careful storage.</p>
              <p><strong>Care:</strong> Dry clean or hand wash cold with wool detergent. Lay flat to dry. Store with cedar blocks. Never hang heavy wool knits (they stretch).</p>
              <p><strong>Tailoring note:</strong> Wool is the tailor's dream fabric. It molds, steams, and presses beautifully. Wool blazers and trousers can be altered extensively. Worth the investment in tailoring.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Silk -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558618666-fcd25c85f82e?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Silk fabric with luxurious sheen and drape" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Silk</h3>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Luxurious feel, beautiful drape and sheen, naturally temperature-regulating, hypoallergenic, takes dye brilliantly, lightweight yet strong.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive, stains easily (especially water marks), delicate, sun damage fades color, requires careful washing or dry cleaning.</p>
              <p><strong>Care:</strong> Hand wash in cold water with pH-neutral detergent or dry clean. Never wring. Press on low heat with a cloth barrier. Store away from direct light.</p>
              <p><strong>Tailoring note:</strong> Silk requires an experienced tailor. The fabric is slippery and shows every needle hole. Pin marks are permanent. Discuss placement before any cutting.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Polyester -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558171813-4c088753af8f?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Polyester blend fabric showing smooth surface" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Polyester</h3>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Wrinkle-resistant, holds shape, quick-drying, durable, affordable, good color retention, great for travel pieces and activewear.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Traps heat and odor, can feel plasticky, pills over time, not breathable, static-prone, microplastic shedding when washed.</p>
              <p><strong>Care:</strong> Machine wash cold, tumble dry low or hang dry. Avoid high heat (it melts). Wash inside-out to reduce pilling. Use a microfiber-catching wash bag.</p>
              <p><strong>Tailoring note:</strong> Polyester melts under high iron heat, so your tailor must use low temperature. Seams can be slippery. Best results when blended with natural fibers.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Rayon / Viscose -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564257631407-4deb1f99d992?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Rayon viscose fabric with fluid drape" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Rayon / Viscose</h3>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Beautiful drape that mimics silk, breathable, absorbs dye well, soft hand feel, relatively affordable, blends well with other fibers.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Weak when wet (shrinks and distorts), wrinkles easily, can pill, loses shape over time, not very durable, often needs dry cleaning.</p>
              <p><strong>Care:</strong> Check the label carefully. Some rayon is machine washable (cold, gentle). Others require dry cleaning only. Always air dry. Never wring or twist.</p>
              <p><strong>Tailoring note:</strong> Rayon is tricky to tailor because it shifts and distorts. Pin carefully, cut with sharp scissors, and work with a tailor experienced in fluid fabrics.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Denim -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541099649105-f69ad21f3246?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Denim jeans fabric close-up showing weave" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Denim</h3>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely durable, ages beautifully, versatile across seasons, holds structure well, available in many weights and finishes.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can bleed dye (especially raw denim), heavy weight not always comfortable, rigid denim limits mobility, shrinks with first wash.</p>
              <p><strong>Care:</strong> Wash inside-out in cold water, infrequently. Hang dry to preserve fit and color. Spot-clean when possible. Raw denim: wait 6 months before first wash for personalized fading.</p>
              <p><strong>Tailoring note:</strong> Denim tailoring requires heavy-duty machines. Not all tailors can work with thick denim. Hemming is the most common alteration. Original hem preservation is a specialty skill worth seeking out.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Cashmere -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1434389677669-e08b4cda3a00?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Cashmere sweater showing soft luxurious texture" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Cashmere</h3>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Incredibly soft, lightweight yet very warm, luxurious feel, naturally elastic, pills less than cheaper wools when quality is high.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive, pills with friction, requires gentle care, moths target it, thinner grades wear through faster, quality varies enormously.</p>
              <p><strong>Care:</strong> Hand wash cold with cashmere shampoo. Press water out gently with a towel (never wring). Lay flat to dry on a mesh rack. Fold to store, never hang. Use a cashmere comb for pilling.</p>
              <p><strong>Tailoring note:</strong> Cashmere is delicate to alter. Find a tailor experienced with knits. Minor adjustments like shortening are possible, but major reshaping risks distorting the fabric.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="detail-tip reveal">
          <h4>The Fabric Blend Rule</h4>
          <p>The best everyday garments are often blends. A cotton-elastane blend (97/3) gives structure with stretch. A wool-silk blend adds drape to suiting. A linen-cotton blend reduces wrinkling. Read the full composition, not just the primary fiber. The ratio matters as much as the ingredients.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- ========== TAB 2: CONSTRUCTION QUALITY ========== -->
      <div class="tab-content" id="tab-construction">
        <div class="section-header reveal">
          <span class="tag">Quality Checklist</span>
          <h2 class="text-h2">Construction Quality</h2>
          <p>You do not need to be a tailor to spot quality. These six checkpoints take 30 seconds and will save you hundreds of dollars in bad purchases every year.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-auto reveal">
          <!-- Seams -->
          <div class="card card-flat">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>1. Seams</h3>
              <p><strong>What to check:</strong> Turn the garment inside out. Seam allowances should be at least 1cm (half an inch) wide. Wider is better because it allows for future alterations.</p>
              <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> Seams are finished (serged, bound, or French-seamed). Edges are clean with no fraying threads. The seam lies flat without puckering.</p>
              <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Raw, unfinished edges. Very narrow seam allowances (less than 5mm). Seams that pucker or pull when you stretch the garment gently.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Stitching -->
          <div class="card card-flat">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>2. Stitching</h3>
              <p><strong>What to check:</strong> Look at both the outside and inside of the garment. Count the stitches per inch. More stitches per inch means stronger, more refined construction.</p>
              <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> Even, consistent stitch length. No skipped stitches. Thread color matches the fabric. Backstitch or bar tack reinforcement at stress points (pockets, zippers, belt loops).</p>
              <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Uneven or loose stitching. Visible skipped stitches. Loose thread ends hanging. Different thread tension on different parts of the same garment.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Buttons -->
          <div class="card card-flat">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>3. Buttons</h3>
              <p><strong>What to check:</strong> Wiggle each button. It should feel secure with no play. Look at the button attachment closely with the garment inside-out.</p>
              <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> Buttons are sewn with a thread shank (a small gap between button and fabric) that allows the buttonhole fabric to sit flat. Extra button included on the tag or inside seam.</p>
              <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Buttons sewn flat to the fabric (they will pop off). Cheap plastic buttons on an otherwise nice garment. Buttons that already wobble on the rack.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Zippers -->
          <div class="card card-flat">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>4. Zippers</h3>
              <p><strong>What to check:</strong> Zip and unzip several times in the store. The zipper should glide smoothly in both directions without catching fabric or requiring force.</p>
              <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> Metal zippers on quality pieces (especially jackets and trousers). YKK brand zippers. Zipper tape color matches the garment. Invisible zippers on dresses sit perfectly flat.</p>
              <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Zipper catches or sticks. Zipper tape is a different color than the garment (cost-cutting). Wavy or uneven zipper installation. Plastic zippers on pieces over $60.</p>

              <h3>5. Lining</h3>
              <p><strong>What to check:</strong> Check if the garment has a lining, especially in blazers, structured dresses, skirts, and trousers. The presence and quality of lining is one of the biggest quality differentiators.</p>
              <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> Full lining in blazers and structured garments. Partial lining through the body of skirts and dresses. Lining has its own seam allowance and moves independently of the outer fabric.</p>
              <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> No lining in a structured blazer (the garment will lose shape). Lining that is stitched directly onto outer fabric seams (it will pull). Cheap, scratchy lining material.</p>

              <h3>6. Fabric Weight &amp; Recovery</h3>
              <p><strong>What to check:</strong> Scrunch a section of the fabric in your hand for five seconds, then release. Watch how the fabric recovers. Also compare the weight of similar garments from different brands.</p>
              <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> Fabric springs back without deep wrinkle lines. The garment has noticeable weight and substance. The fabric has a consistent hand feel across the entire piece.</p>
              <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Fabric stays wrinkled after the scrunch test. The garment feels paper-thin or flimsy. You can see your hand through the fabric (unless it is intentionally sheer).</p>

          <h4>The 30-Second Store Test</h4>
          <p>Before you take anything to the fitting room, do this: (1) Check the label for fabric composition. (2) Turn it inside-out and look at the seams. (3) Wiggle a button. (4) Scrunch and release the fabric. If it fails any of these, put it back. You just saved yourself 10 minutes of trying on a garment you would have returned anyway.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="detail-tip reveal">
          <h4>Pro Tip: Pattern Matching</h4>
          <p>On striped or plaid garments, check if the pattern lines up at the seams, especially at the side seams, pockets, and center front. Pattern matching is one of the most reliable indicators of higher-quality manufacturing. It costs more to cut fabric with pattern matching, so budget brands rarely bother.</p>

          <h2 class="text-h2">Brand Sizing Guide</h2>
          <p>Your size is not a fixed number. It is a suggestion that varies wildly between brands. Knowing which brands run small, true, or large saves time, money, and frustration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="detail-tip reveal">
          <h4>The Golden Rule of Sizing</h4>
          <p>Never buy based on the size on the tag. Always try on, or measure yourself and compare against the brand's specific size chart. A size 8 at one brand can be a 4 at another. The number means nothing. The fit means everything.</p>

          <h2 class="text-h2">Online Shopping Mastery</h2>
          <p>Over 60% of clothing is now purchased online. Most returns happen because of fit. Here is how to dramatically reduce your return rate and shop online like a professional stylist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-auto reveal">
          <!-- Reading Product Photos -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742049-0cfed4f6a45d?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Woman shopping online on laptop with clothing packages" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Reading Product Photos</h3>
              <p><strong>Model shots:</strong> Note the model's listed height and size. If she is 5'10" wearing a size S, the dress will be shorter and tighter on you if you are 5'4".</p>
              <p><strong>Flat lay vs. on-body:</strong> Flat lays show structure but lie about drape. On-body photos show drape but can be pinned in the back. Look for both.</p>
              <p><strong>Customer photos:</strong> These are your best resource. Sort reviews by your body type and size. Real photos on real bodies tell the truth that marketing photos hide.</p>
              <p><strong>Color accuracy:</strong> Screen colors vary. Check multiple photos under different lighting. Read reviews specifically mentioning color accuracy.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Measurement Strategy -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512436991641-6745cdb1723f?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Tape measure on fabric for body measurements" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Measurement Strategy</h3>
              <p><strong>Your body measurements:</strong> Keep an updated set: bust, waist, hips, inseam, shoulder width, and arm length. Measure over undergarments you typically wear.</p>
              <p><strong>Garment measurements vs. body measurements:</strong> Some brands list garment measurements (the actual fabric dimensions), others list body measurements (your body size the garment fits). Know which you are reading.</p>
              <p><strong>Compare to what you own:</strong> Measure a garment that fits you perfectly. Compare those measurements to the size chart. This is more reliable than body measurements alone.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Return Policy Strategy -->

            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Return Policy Strategy</h3>
              <p><strong>Before you buy:</strong> Check the return policy. Look for free returns, the return window length, and whether final-sale items are marked. Bookmark the returns page.</p>
              <p><strong>Bracket sizing:</strong> Order two sizes of the same item if returns are free. Try both at home in good lighting with the shoes and undergarments you will actually wear. Return the one that does not work.</p>
              <p><strong>Keep tags on:</strong> Always keep tags attached until you are 100% certain. Try on at home but do not wear out until the decision is made. Many stores will not accept returns on worn items.</p>
              <p><strong>Track return windows:</strong> Set a calendar reminder for the return deadline the day you receive the package. Never let a return window close on something you meant to send back.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Red Flags -->
          <div class="card">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742031-c6961e8560b0?w=500&h=375&fit=crop&q=80" alt="Warning signs in online clothing listings" class="card-img" loading="lazy">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Online Red Flags</h3>
              <p><strong>No fabric composition listed:</strong> If they will not tell you what the garment is made of, it is almost certainly cheap polyester. Reputable brands always list materials.</p>
              <p><strong>Only model shots, no flat lay:</strong> This can mean the garment looks worse when it is not styled and pinned on a model. Look for multiple photo angles.</p>
              <p><strong>No size chart:</strong> A brand without a size chart either does not care about fit or does not want you to know how the garment actually measures. Avoid.</p>
              <p><strong>Too-good prices on "luxury" items:</strong> A cashmere sweater for $25 is not cashmere. A "silk" blouse for $18 is not silk. If the price does not match the claimed fabric, the label is lying.</p>
              <p><strong>Reviews that look fake:</strong> All 5-star reviews with generic language, posted on the same date, or with stock photos are red flags. Look for reviews with specific fit details.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="detail-tip reveal">
          <h4>Pro Tip: The Wish List Method</h4>
          <p>Add items to your cart or wish list, then wait 48 hours. If you still want it after two days, buy it. This eliminates impulse purchases driven by marketing urgency ("only 3 left!" or "sale ends tonight!"). Most flash urgency is manufactured. The item will still be there or something better will replace it.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Cost-Per-Wear Calculation</h3>
              <p>The true cost of a garment is not its price tag. It is the price divided by the number of times you wear it.</p>
              <p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Purchase Price + Tailoring Cost) / Number of Wears = Cost Per Wear</p>
              <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> $200 wool blazer + $30 tailoring = $230 total. Worn 150 times = $1.53 per wear. Excellent value.</p>
              <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> $35 trendy top. Worn 4 times before it pills or goes out of style = $8.75 per wear. Poor value.</p>
              <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> $15 basic white t-shirt. Worn 40 times = $0.38 per wear. Outstanding value.</p>
              <p>The most expensive garments are the cheap ones you never wear.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Investment vs. Trend Pieces</h3>
              <p><strong>Invest more in:</strong> Outerwear (coats, blazers), denim, footwear, bags, suiting, and anything you wear 3+ times per week. These are the backbone of your wardrobe.</p>
              <p><strong>Spend less on:</strong> Trend-driven pieces, seasonal novelty items, occasion-specific pieces you will wear once or twice, and items in colors or patterns that cycle out quickly.</p>
              <p><strong>The 70/30 rule:</strong> Aim for 70% of your budget on investment pieces (basics and essentials with high wear count) and 30% on trend or seasonal items that keep your wardrobe feeling current.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>The 30-Wear Rule</h3>
              <p>Before purchasing any garment, ask yourself one question: <strong>"Will I wear this at least 30 times?"</strong></p>
              <p>If the answer is no, put it down. It does not matter how cheap it is. A $10 top worn twice costs more per wear than a $100 top worn 100 times.</p>
              <p><strong>How to apply it:</strong> Visualize 30 specific outfits or occasions where you would wear this piece. Can you name them? If you struggle to get past 10, it is not worth buying.</p>
              <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Special occasion pieces (wedding guest dresses, formal gowns) are exempt. But even then, consider renting instead of buying for one-time events.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Seasonal Strategy -->
          <div class="card">

            <div class="card-body">
              <h3>Seasonal Budget Planning</h3>
              <p><strong>Set an annual wardrobe budget:</strong> Decide on a yearly amount, then divide it by season. This prevents overspending in January sales and having nothing left for fall essentials.</p>
              <p><strong>Buy off-season:</strong> Winter coats are cheapest in February/March. Summer dresses drop in September. Buying 4-6 weeks after a season's peak gives you the best discounts on quality pieces.</p>
              <p><strong>The one-in-one-out rule:</strong> For every new piece that enters your closet, one piece must leave. This forces intentional purchasing and prevents closet overflow.</p>
              <p><strong>Track your spending:</strong> Use a simple spreadsheet or note to log every clothing purchase. Review quarterly. You will be shocked at what you learn about your spending patterns.</p>

        <div class="detail-tip reveal">
          <h4>Pro Tip: The Tailoring Budget</h4>
          <p>Set aside 10-15% of your clothing budget specifically for tailoring. A $50 dress that costs $20 to tailor ($70 total) will outperform a $150 dress off the rack that does not fit properly. Tailoring transforms good garments into great ones, and it makes affordable pieces look expensive. This is the single highest-return investment in your wardrobe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="detail-tip reveal">
          <h4>The Wardrobe Audit</h4>
          <p>Twice a year, pull everything out of your closet. Separate into three piles: (1) Love and wear regularly, (2) Have not worn in 6+ months, and (3) Does not fit. For pile 2, decide if tailoring can fix it. For pile 3, donate or sell. Pile 1 shows you what you actually wear. Let that guide your next purchases, not what you wish you wore.</p>

              Divide the total price of the garment (including any tailoring costs) by the number of times you realistically expect to wear it. A $200 blazer worn 100 times costs $2 per wear. A $30 trendy top worn 3 times costs $10 per wear. Always aim for the lowest cost-per-wear possible on investment pieces.

              Avoid 100% polyester in items worn close to the skin (it traps heat and odor), very thin rayon that pills after one wash, and acrylic knits that lose shape quickly. Look for cotton blends, quality polyester blends with at least 3% spandex for recovery, and fabrics with a visible weave structure that indicates substance.

              Check five things: seam allowances should be at least 1cm wide, stitching should be even with no loose threads, buttons should be sewn with a thread shank (small gap between button and fabric), zippers should glide smoothly without catching, and the fabric should bounce back when you scrunch it in your hand for five seconds.

              Before buying any garment, ask yourself: "Will I wear this at least 30 times?" If the answer is no, it is likely a waste of money regardless of how cheap it is. This simple rule eliminates most impulse purchases and helps you build a wardrobe of pieces you genuinely love and use repeatedly.

              Always check the size chart and measure yourself with a tape measure. Read the fabric composition on the product page. Look at customer photos rather than model shots. Check the return policy before purchasing. Order two sizes if unsure and plan to return one. Avoid final-sale items on first purchases from any brand.

              Yes, for basic alterations. A $15 hem on $40 trousers makes them look like $150 trousers. A $20 dart adjustment on a $30 blouse gives you a custom fit. However, skip complex alterations (like reshaping shoulders) on cheap garments. The rule: if the alteration costs more than 50% of the garment price and the garment is under $50, reconsider.
